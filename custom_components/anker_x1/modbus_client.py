"""Pure decode helpers for Anker SOLIX X1 Modbus registers.

No Home Assistant imports — this module is HA-agnostic so it can be
unit-tested independently.

Encoding rules (verified on real hardware):
- u16   : raw unsigned 16-bit value
- i16   : 16-bit two's complement
- u32   : little-endian word order — low word at lower address
           value = regs[0] | (regs[1] << 16)
- i32   : same word order, then 32-bit two's complement
- string: low-byte-first within each register (low byte then high byte);
           decode as ASCII; cut at first NUL; strip whitespace

Note: this little-word-first order applies to the native Anker register
bank (10000-11134) only. The embedded SunSpec bank (10698+ / 40000+) uses
the opposite, standard SunSpec big-word-first order and is not decoded by
the helpers below.

    - the unit genuinely lacks the register: every poll pays a full

    - the LINK glitched: one IO error skews the pymodbus transaction stream

    Retiring on the first timeout cannot distinguish them, so a block is
    retired only after ``threshold`` CONSECUTIVE timeouts. A retired block is

    a meter power-cycled, a link repaired — recovers on its own instead of
